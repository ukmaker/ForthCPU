@W: FX474 |User-specified initial value defined for some sequential elements which can prevent optimum synthesis results from being achieved. 
@W: MT529 :"c:\users\duncan\git\forthcpu\devboard\source\devboard.v":111:0:111:5|Found inferred clock mcu|PIN_CLK_X1 which controls 303 sequential elements including boardInst.BPIN_LED[7:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance. 
@W: MT529 :"c:\users\duncan\git\forthcpu\devboard\source\devboard.v":84:1:84:2|Found inferred clock mcu|PIN_RESETN which controls 24 sequential elements including boardInst.DIN_GPIO[7]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
