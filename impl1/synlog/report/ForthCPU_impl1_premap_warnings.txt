@W: FX474 |User-specified initial value defined for some sequential elements which can prevent optimum synthesis results from being achieved. 
@W: MT529 :"c:\users\duncan\git\forthcpu\debugport\source\register.v":14:0:14:5|Found inferred clock mcu|PIN_CLK_X1 which controls 392 sequential elements including coreInst.dinLatch.DOUT[15:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance. 
@W: MT529 :"c:\users\duncan\git\forthcpu\debugport\source\synchronizer.v":25:0:25:5|Found inferred clock mcu|PIN_DEBUG_WRN which controls 25 sequential elements including coreInst.debugger.requestGen.modeReqReg.Q_R[0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
