@W: FX474 |User-specified initial value defined for some sequential elements which can prevent optimum synthesis results from being achieved. 
@W: BZ101 |Potential glitch can occur at the output of 9 instances  
@W: MT531 :"c:\users\duncan\git\forthcpu\instructionphasedecoder\source\instructionphasedecoder.v":57:1:57:4|Found signal identified as System clock which controls 4 sequential elements including coreInst.instructionPhaseDecoderInst.PHASE_NEXT[3].  Using this clock, which has no specified timing constraint, can prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and can adversely impact design performance. 
@W: MT529 :"c:\users\duncan\git\forthcpu\debugport\source\synchronizer.v":36:0:36:5|Found inferred clock mcu|PIN_CLK_X1 which controls 349 sequential elements including coreInst.debugger.requestGen.modeReqReg.Q[0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance. 
@W: MT529 :"c:\users\duncan\git\forthcpu\debugport\source\synchronizer.v":25:0:25:5|Found inferred clock mcu|DEBUG_WRN_1_inferred_clock which controls 25 sequential elements including coreInst.debugger.requestGen.modeReqReg.Q_R[0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
