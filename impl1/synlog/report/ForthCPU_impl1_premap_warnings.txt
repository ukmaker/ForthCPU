@W: FX474 |User-specified initial value defined for some sequential elements which can prevent optimum synthesis results from being achieved. 
@W: MT531 :"c:\users\duncan\git\forthcpu\devboard\source\devboard.v":111:0:111:5|Found signal identified as System clock which controls 252 sequential elements including mcuInst.boardInst.PIN_LED[7:0].  Using this clock, which has no specified timing constraint, can prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and can adversely impact design performance.
