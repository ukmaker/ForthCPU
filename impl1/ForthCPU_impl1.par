INFO: Design contains EBR with ASYNC Reset Mode that has a limitation: The use of the EBR block asynchronous reset requires that certain timing be met between the clock and the reset within the memory block. See the device specific data sheet for additional details.
Number of Signals: 2288
Number of Connections: 7368
 
WARNING - par: When using the Master SPI interface for configuration, it is recommended that the PROGRAMN, DONE and INITN pins be used. Refer to the MachXO3L Handbook for information on these three ports.
WARNING - par: The SN pin is not available for use as a general purpose I/O pin when the SLAVE_SPI_PORT attribute is enabled.  The SN pin should be tied high with an external pull-up if you are not using the Slave SPI port for configuration.

Pin Constraint Summary:
   14 out of 62 pins locked (22% locked).

The following 1 signal is selected to use the primary clock routing resources:
    PIN_CLK_X1_c (driver: PIN_CLK_X1, clk load #: 196)


The following 6 signals are selected to use the secondary clock routing resources:
    PIN_RESETN_c (driver: PIN_RESETN, clk load #: 12, sr load #: 20, ce load #: 0)
    mcuResourcesInst/EN_RAM (driver: SLICE_387, clk load #: 0, sr load #: 0, ce load #: 34)
    coreInst/programCounterInst/PC_A5 (driver: coreInst/programCounterInst/SLICE_946, clk load #: 0, sr load #: 0, ce load #: 16)
    DECODE_c (driver: coreInst/instructionPhaseDecoderInst/SLICE_274, clk load #: 0, sr load #: 1, ce load #: 14)
    mcuResourcesInst/UARTInst/uartRXInst/r_RX_DV8 (driver: mcuResourcesInst/UARTInst/uartRXInst/SLICE_429, clk load #: 0, sr load #: 10, ce load #: 0)
    mcuResourcesInst/DATA_AVAILABLE_R_0_sqmuxa (driver: mcuResourcesInst/SLICE_699, clk load #: 0, sr load #: 0, ce load #: 10)

WARNING - par: Signal "PIN_RESETN_c" is selected to use Secondary clock resources. However, its driver comp "PIN_RESETN" is located at "B3", which is not a dedicated pin for connecting to Secondary clock resources. General routing has to be used to route this signal, and it might suffer from excessive delay or skew.
Signal PIN_RESETN_c is selected as Global Set/Reset.

*****************************************************************
Info: NBR allows conflicts(one node used by more than one signal)
      in the earlier iterations. In each iteration, it tries to  
      solve the conflicts while keeping the critical connections 
      routed as short as possible. The routing process is said to
      be completed when no conflicts exist and all connections   
      are routed.                                                
Note: NBR uses a different method to calculate timing slacks. The
      worst slack and total negative slack may not be the same as
      that in TRCE report. You should always run TRCE to verify  
      your design.
